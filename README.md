# Hola ðŸ‘‹

I am a ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ software engineer from Houston, Texas. My first exposure to this field came in the 8th grade at Sharpstown Middle School where I took a robotics class. There I got to build LEGO Mindstorms robots and compete in San Antonio. That really sparked my passion for robotics, programming, and being from Houston, space!

I started off my career at Lone Star Community College where I studied computer science. Whilst there, I had the opportunity to participate in [NCAS](https://nasaostem.okstate.edu/legacy/alumni.html) and go to Johnson Space Center. I got to meet incredible engineers and work on fun projects.

After Lone Star, I transferred over to the University of Houston-Downtown campus to finish my BS in computer science. At UHD, I worked on an awesome NASA competition named the [NASA Swarmathon](http://nasaswarmathon.com). The goal of this competition was to engage Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI) and get students to develop innovative foraging algorithms for robot swarms. Based on this experience, and after numerous tries, I got my first two internships at NASA's Stennis Space Center working at the Autonomous Systems Lab. At the ASL I developed algorithms for autonomous health management of rocket engine tests, such as the Space Shuttle's RS-25 engine being used for the Space Launch System (SLS). Right before graduating with my Bachelors, I got to do one more internship at NASA, this time at Johnson Space Center, in the Hybrid Reality Lab. I got to work with astronauts to develop deep learning algorithms for merging EEG with a highly immersive hybrid reality training environment. 

Upon graduation, I worked as a flight software engineer at [Firefly Aerospace](https://firefly.com) on the Alpha ðŸš€. At Firefly, I got to write flight software code in C++ on the VxWorks RTOS. Being a small New Space startup, I also had the chance to work on a number of things including setting up the hardware-in-the-loop lab software, develop propulsion models for our NASA [Trick](https://github.com/nasa/trick) simulation tools, utilities for the company, and even some avionics harness designs.

Now I am a ðŸ›° flight software engineer at [Emergent Space Technologies](https://www.emergentspace.com/) working on cool spacecraft projects and missions.

I have a passion for embedded systems and reinforcement learning. My goal is to be able to advance the state-of-the-art in spacecraft autonomy by incorporating modern machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques on resource-constrained spacecraft.
